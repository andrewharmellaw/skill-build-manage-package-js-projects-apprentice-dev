    * Breakdown of `package.json`
    * Understanding project structure and what to version control

## [BADGES]
  * JavaScript Build Tools

## [EXPERIENCE SUGGESTIONS]
  * npm provides a huge amount of tooling (not just package management) and so for small-medium projects that don't require other, more advanced tools, you can simply use _only_ npm and npm packages. For larger projects that require a corporate-standard of stability: using tools like yarn, webpack and grunt can provide extra functionality that npm doesn't fully cover.
  * Yarn is effectively npm with some added features to make installing packages faster and cleaner (in terms of CLI output). The addition of the yarn lock file is also pretty neat to avoid version mis-matching.
  * For a lot of things, Grunt isn't really necessary as we can install, manage and run any tools, test frameworks and applications all using npm scripts.
